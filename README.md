# meta-genrative-ai-api

This is an [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) app that provides clients the ability to query meta's generative ai models (including [llama-2](https://llama.meta.com/)) using [replicate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/replicate) npm package and stores the responses in a NoSQL database.

#### A video of a live demo + more comments are coming soon

e.g. REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_unique_api_token
